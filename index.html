          <p>
            As a full-stack developer with 2 years of experience,
            I've honed my skills in crafting robust and scalable applications 
            from the ground up. My expertise spans both application and 
            presentation layers, allowing me to deliver comprehensive solutions 
            tailored to client needs. <br>

            I've successfully deployed applications and microservices on the IBM Cloud, 
            leveraging its powerful infrastructure to drive innovation. My passion for AI 
            and natural language processing has led me to become an avid user of 
            IBM Watson Services. I've applied Watson Assistant, NLU, and Sentiment Analyzer 
            to create intelligent and engaging user experiences.
